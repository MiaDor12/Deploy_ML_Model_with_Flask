# Deploy ML Model with Flask
* I wanted to learn the besics of HTML, CSS and flask, so I built a web app that predicts the chances of having Coronavirus given symptoms.
* I used the data released by the Israeli Ministry of Health regarding tests carried out on people who were suspected of being Coronavirus patients.
* The data is probably biased as a result of the way it is collected, and especially because no motivation is given for testing each subject. I guess there are just a few if any healthy people with no reason to take the test that are included in the data. This will definitely cause a systemic error in the predictions.
